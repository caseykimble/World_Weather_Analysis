# World Weather Analysis


The purpose of this repository was to gain experience using Python APIs to gather weather data and create maps to show different travel destinations around the world where clients can plan trips and find hotels based on their ideal weather conditions. I began by generating a list of latitudes and longitudes, narrowing down that list with certain weather parameters. I made several maps based on weather conditions such as humidity, temperature and wind speed. I also used linear regression to find correlation between latitude and these same weather conditions. 

For the challenge assignment I filtered the weather data to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, using Google Maps Directions API, I mapped out an itinerary and travel route consisting of a start and end location, with three stops in between, shown on a marker layer map.
